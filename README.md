# Scientific Calculator

## Description

The **Scientific Calculator** is a **console-based Java application** that allows users to perform various mathematical operations, including **basic arithmetic**, **scientific functions**, and **factorial calculations**. This program leverages **Java's Math library** to execute calculations accurately.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (\*), Division (/).
- **Scientific Functions**:
  - Trigonometric Functions: Sine (sin), Cosine (cos), Tangent (tan), Secant (sec), Cosecant (cosec), Cotangent (cot).
  - Logarithmic Functions: Natural logarithm (ln), Base-10 logarithm (log).
  - Exponential Functions: Exponential (exp), Square (x²), Cube (x³), Square root (√).
- **Factorial Calculation**: Computes the factorial of a given number.

## Usage

1. **Compile the program**
   ```sh
   javac ScientificCal.java
   ```
2. **Run the program**
   ```sh
   java ScientificCal
   ```
3. **Select an operation type**:
   - Enter `1` for Basic Operations
   - Enter `2` for Scientific Functions
   - Enter `3` for Factorial Calculation
4. **Follow the prompts** to enter numbers and operators.

## Example Input & Output

```
Select operation type: 1 for Basic, 2 for Scientific, 3 for Factorial

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
Result of basic operation: 15.0
```

```
Select operation type: 2 for Scientific
Enter the number: 45
Enter the scientific operator (sin, cos, tan, log, square, cube, sqrt, exp): sin
Result of scientific operation: 0.7071
```
